<h1 align="center">Challenge #317 [Intermediate] Counting Elements</h1>
In this challenge you receive a chemical formula (e.g H3PO4), and the program
must return the number of atoms of each element. Using again as a reference
the example before the output could be: H->3, P->1, O->4.

The challenge is really trivial for inputs like the one before. However, if you take
into account elements with more than one letter (e.g Cl) and formulas with many
brackets, possibly nested, the challenge gets trickier.
