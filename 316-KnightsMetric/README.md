<h1 align="center">Challenge #316 [Easy] Knight's Metric</h1>

In this challenge you receive two points: a start and a goal. The objective is to 
produce a path from the start point to the goal point using L-shaped move. We assume the board is not
bounded. In the program source code you can see the different simple approaches
that can be taken to solve the problem, with their respective pros and cons.
